# DecisionTree & Random Forest
This project aims to predict final exam scores using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The approach leverages advanced techniques including Glorot uniform initialization, dropout regularization, and the Adam Max optimizer with batch processing to optimize predictive performance. Comprehensive data preprocessing was essential, with steps including standardization, normalization, and robust feature engineering. Outliers were managed effectively using the IQR method.

## Dataset
The dataset (StudentPerformanceFactors.csv) includes both numerical and categorical variables that capture various aspects of student academic and lifestyle data. Significant effort was put into re-labeling and accurately interpreting the categorical data through additional research and feature engineering.

## Key Features

Hours_Studied: Total hours dedicated to studying.

Tutoring_Sessions: Number of tutoring sessions attended.

Sleep_Hours: Average number of hours of sleep.

## Installation & Setup
